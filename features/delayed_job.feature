Feature: Bugsnag detects errors in Delayed job workers

Scenario: An unhandled RuntimeError sends a report with arguments
  Given I run the service "delayed_job" with the command "bundle exec rake delayed_job_tests:fail_with_args"
  And I wait to receive a request
  Then the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Ruby Bugsnag Notifier"
  And the event "unhandled" is true
  And the event "severity" equals "error"
  And the event "context" equals "TestModel.fail_with_args"
  And the event "severityReason.type" equals "unhandledExceptionMiddleware"
  And the event "severityReason.attributes.framework" equals "DelayedJob"
  And the exception "errorClass" equals "RuntimeError"
  And the event "metaData.job.class" equals "Delayed::Backend::ActiveRecord::Job"
  And the event "metaData.job.id" is not null
  And the event "metaData.job.attempt" equals 1
  And the event "metaData.job.max_attempts" equals 1
  And the event "metaData.job.payload.display_name" equals "TestModel.fail_with_args"
  And the event "metaData.job.payload.method_name" equals "fail_with_args"
  And the payload field "events.0.metaData.job.payload.args.0" equals "Test"

Scenario: A handled exception sends a report
  Given I run the service "delayed_job" with the command "bundle exec rake delayed_job_tests:notify_with_args"
  And I wait to receive a request
  Then the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Ruby Bugsnag Notifier"
  And the event "unhandled" is false
  And the event "severity" equals "warning"
  And the event "context" equals "TestModel.notify_with_args"
  And the event "severityReason.type" equals "handledException"
  And the exception "errorClass" equals "RuntimeError"
  And the event "metaData.job.class" equals "Delayed::Backend::ActiveRecord::Job"
  And the event "metaData.job.id" is not null
  And the event "metaData.job.attempt" equals 1
  And the event "metaData.job.max_attempts" equals 1
  And the event "metaData.job.payload.display_name" equals "TestModel.notify_with_args"
  And the event "metaData.job.payload.method_name" equals "notify_with_args"
  And the payload field "events.0.metaData.job.payload.args.0" equals "Test"
