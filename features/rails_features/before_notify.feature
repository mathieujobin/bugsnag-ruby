  And the event "unhandled" is false
  And the event "app.type" equals "rails"
  And the event "metaData.request.url" ends with "/before_notify/handled"
  And the event "metaData.before_notify.source" equals "rails_before_handled"
  And the event "metaData.controller.name" equals "BeforeNotifyController"
